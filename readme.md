# Localization

Dashboard and its modules are localized using [Translate Shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell).  All of the HTML files within '/src' are parsed and any tags with `translate="yes"` are translated.

The translations are stored within each project's `/languages` folder.  Corrections are welcome and can be contributed by clicking the pencil on the Github website, or forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
